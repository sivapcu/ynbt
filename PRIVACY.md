## How it works
	
* It removes all the tracking codes after `?`,  before saving.  
**ex**  

>`http://example.org/blog/sample-post/?utm_content=bufferb35b8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer` will be saved as
		`http://example.org/blog/sample-post/`

* It converts all the short urls into long url before saving them.  
**ex**

> `https://goo.gl/TwTqh` will be saved as`https://www.google.co.in`

* Any urls opened from this application will send, no referrer

```<a href="www.example.com" rel="noreferrer">noreferrer!</a>```

>When example.com receives the HTTP request generated by clicking this link, the HTTP Referer field will be empty, as if the user had navigated from about:blank.

* Once you decide and delete an article, it goes straight out of db. The app won't store anything beyond necessary.** *No* ** soft deletion gimmicks.
